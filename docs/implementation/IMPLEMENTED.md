# Implemented delivery ledger

No Platform runtime Slice is terminally Implemented. The following
repository-control-plane Slice is terminally recorded:

## PF-B1-S01 — Repository, standards, agents and validation foundation

- Status: **Implemented / terminal**
- Historical plan: [`plan/completed/pf-b1-s01-repository-foundation.md`](../../plan/completed/pf-b1-s01-repository-foundation.md)
- Accepted candidate: `d1737088b47e3180ac250f3f268c1d92e9719f17`
- Evidence: independent engineering review, independent tester acceptance,
  foundation audit, full/local validation, routing/contract tests and clean
  candidate-bound diff checks all passed.
- Runtime, migration, unit, integration, race and container profiles were
  `NOT_APPLICABLE` because their prerequisites are not introduced by this
  Slice.
- No CTRL/IMS code, data, migration or authority was changed.

## PF-B1-S02 — Platform ownership and shared contracts

- Status: **Implemented / terminal**
- Historical plan: [`plan/completed/pf-b1-s02-ownership-contracts.md`](../../plan/completed/pf-b1-s02-ownership-contracts.md)
- Accepted implementation candidate: `b8d8174ebb1ff659c3c3c7db5c420314b6f00b7c`
- Evidence: independent engineering review, independent tester acceptance,
  architecture/security/quality validation and contract assertions all passed.
- Runtime and data migration profiles were `NOT_APPLICABLE` because this Slice
  changes contracts and documentation only.
- No CTRL/IMS code, data, migration or authority was changed.
